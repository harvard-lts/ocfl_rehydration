and girls be put upon their feet by the             -
   in a congenial occupation which shall be a constant incentive to
better effort, inciting hopes for a better life and a better living, and their
own desires/and the impetus given them will then carry them past a
hundred shallows and quicksands which are else so threatening.
   No claim of originality is made for the plan here presented. Almost
every feature is something which the experience of faithful workers in sim-
ilar fields, in New York and elsewhere, has approved as expedient and effi-
cient The general idea of an institution meeting the social and intellectual
needs of the people of the North End is not new. Such an idea was elab-
orated and urged with great force by Mr. George S. Hale a few years ago,
and others have urged it from time to time. The North End Union, work-
ing practically and modestly with the means at its command, has attempted
to realize this idea
   A Union built on these foundations, having in mind the physical,
the intellectual, moral, social, political, and industrial needs of the people
of the North End; combining in a measure the trade school, university-
extension, the lyceum, the neighborhood guild, and the social settlement;
always ready to learn and to improve its methods; reaching out a helping
hand whenever from time to time it is clearly needed-such an institution,
we believe, is imperatively demanded at the North End, and in its behalf
we appeal to the generosity and public spirit of the people of,Boston.
