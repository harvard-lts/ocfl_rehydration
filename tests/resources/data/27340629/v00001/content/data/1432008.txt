           THE NORTH END UNION was opened January I, 1892 at 20 Par-
       menter Street  Its object, as stated at the outset, was "to make a social
       home for young men, stimulate mental activity, promote good citizenship,
       and lend a hand wherever needed."   How this was best to be done was
       the problem.  Situated in the midst of a population, many of whom are
       foreign born, composed almost entirely of Hebrews and Catholics, it was
       clear that the work should be absolutely unsectarian. Recognizing that
       self and independence are endangered by the giving of something
       for nothing, a small fee for the privileges of the Union was required.
       The accommodations of the building were such as to seriously limit the
       work which the Union had in mind.   The large hall and gymnasium were
       adequate for their purposes, but the one small room had to be used as a
       reception room, game room, reading room, and office, to the confusion of
       each purpose.  The gymnasium gave accommodation to various gymnastic
       and other classes, and the large hall to weekly entertainments, girls' clubs,
       sewing classes, kitchen garden, etc  The Children's House at No. 32
       Pannenter Street which became a part of the Union in March, has drawn
       together a large number of children by its various classes for sewing,
       mending dressmaking manual training, and singing, and its play room for
       the little ones.
           Work of this kind, as those who have been longest engaged in it
       well know, is always more or less experimental; it is necessary to study
       the problems continually in connection with the work itself and to add
       or subtract as'practical experience may determine. The observation and
       experience of the past year in the work of the Union and Children's
       House have emphasized to -the minds of all concerned how large and
       important the needs are which the Union may be made to meet.      The
       North End is a tenement-iioose distriasW ng wfth children. These
      children are to be the fathers and mothers and the cilzens of the Boston
      of tomorrow.   It is not only important it is absolutely necessary, that
      such opportunities shall be provided for them as shall counteract the
                        .
      adverse. influences of their environment, 'Ul tIJe fro Anf hard conditions J
      of poverty.  This mad- bethe work of a Union large enough to compre-
      hend children, young people, and men and women providing for each
      that which each most needs, in a way so definite that, while the work
      for each shall be distinct, each step shall so overlap the next that there
