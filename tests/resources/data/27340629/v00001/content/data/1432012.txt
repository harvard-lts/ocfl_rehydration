    We have to consider carefully also the industrial .side.  It should
never be forgotten that the paramount, perennial, pressing question with
the great majority of those reached by an institution like the North End
Union is how to get the necessities of life. If .the Union can help by ever
so little to solve this problem it will have earned its right to be. The
Union can.encourage habits of thrift and economy by helping its people
to save against the day of need, by making it possible for them to buy
coal and other necessities .of life , at a minimum profit ; but this is only
scratching the surface-. the root lies deeper. At an early boys and
girls here are pushed out into world to begin the struggle for a living.
The city has done what it could to give them a mental outfit, but many
are obliged to leave school long before the completion of the grammar school
                                                   .
course and go to work. Wages depend upon how well skilled the hands are,
and .theeyes.  With and eyes untrained in- any definite way to .any
definite end, these boys and girls drift into occupations which are but make-
shifts _ _with nothing to -determine the occupation for which they are best
fitted, or to give chance for preference. The result is restlessness and a
from one thing to another; and the product in the end is, too-often, a
loafer. Every boy and girl may be so taught that the knowledge gained may
be stepping-to future occupations. A boy should not be driven
into an occupation like a peg into a hole. There should be opportunity
for choice. Interest in some direction should be developed, making pos-
sible intelligent .preference and - choice. Let the Union provide work-
shops where boys and girls may learn the fundamental principles of vari-
ous trades, taught not merely with reference to mental discipline, but
as looking directly towards a vocation and a means of living.    Manual
training is recognized as having a distinctive educational value, and on

that account is being introduced into our schools ; it does not aim to go
beyond that. It may not now be within the province of the public schools
to go farther; but for those who have developed a taste for technical edu-
cation in the schools, for those who are earnestly seeking more congenial
occupations and occupations in which they can be more efficient, for all
who for any reason desire it, such provisions should be made to fit them-
selves better for trades which are remunerative and for which they are
adapted.  Trade schools, in the full sense are not here urged, as these may
doubtless be conducted better independently; but the fundamental principles
which underlie trades can be taught with direct reference to their appli-
cation. Free and mechanical drawing enables the mind to grasp
conceptions of form and proportion.   These conceptions wrought out in
wood become skillful carpentry; in iron, forge and machine work ; in
fabrics, millinery and dressmaking ; and with colors, sign painting and
                  '
fresco work.        . .   .
    The value of this ind riArST work in connection with an effort like
