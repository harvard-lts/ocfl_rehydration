may be one continuous progress from childhood to age.        The ideal
Union should develop the physical, social, educational, industrial, and
moral sides of life, and lend a helping hand wherever it can serve human
needs.
    The physical side may be provided for by gymnasium, bowling alleys,
billiard and pool tables. The Union may promote outdoor sports and
excursions to the.country or the shore ; it may own its "abandoned farm,"
or a dozen acres on the shore of some lake, with a log cabin fitted up
with the simplest accommodations, together wkh a few boats which shall
be at the disposal for two weeks in summer of different camping clubs
of boys who shall have earned a right to its privileges by the payment
of a small sum per month during the year.
    The social side of a work. like that undertaken by the Union- is .of
signal importance. A tenement of two or three rooms which accommodates
the whole round of cooking, washing, eating and sleeping, and often
provides for workshop, offers but little of that which makes home life
cheerful 'and attractive. It is not to be wondered at that members of such
households demand something else.    The Union should make itself the
centre of a full and attractive social life; its parlors should be bright
with light and pictures, with cozy nooks and inviting chairs ; .it should
have its reading -room and library, its game room, a smoking room for
the men, and a general reception room where all may exchange greetings.
Books and papers should be scattered about upon its .tables, that they
may become familiar by their simple presence and tempt visitors .to fill
up an idle moment by reading.                                   .
    We would urge in this connection the importance of making the
Union the centre of a regular " social settlement " of the same general
character as the social settlements which are accomplishing so much
good in London, in New York and Chicago, and in Boston itself.    There
should surely be at all times in Boston a half dozen young men willing
and anxious to make their temporary home here to study-the social prob
lems presented in the surrounding streets, and to take an active part
in the Union's .educational and philanthropic work.  We commend -this
                                                                        .
matter to the earnest consideration of young men in the theological and
other schools of Boston and the neighborhood, as well 'as to those already
engaged jo regular vocations in the city.
