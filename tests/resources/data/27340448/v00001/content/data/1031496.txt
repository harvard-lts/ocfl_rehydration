   The College Women of the Present and Future

       So rapid has been the progress of the great social and 
intel   lectual revolution known as the higher or collegiate education of
   women, that it has, so to speak, no past but exists entirely in the
   present time, and its future development, more perhaps than that
   of any other movement of the Nineteenth Century, may be expected
   to create anew the heavens and the earth of the Twentieth Century.
   In 1870, or thereabouts, the time had come throughout the civilised
   world for women to be educated, and in the late fifties and early
   sixties girls began to be born with an instinctive desire to go to
   college. I was one of those girls, and I know from talking with
   other women of my own age that there were hundreds like me.
   Although throughout my girlhood I had never known a woman
   who had gone to college nor seen any one who had seen a woman
   who had gone to college, I well remember that from the time I
   was ten years old I dreamed of college by day and night until my
   parents yielded, as everything must yield to such a longing, and
   took me to the entrance examinations of Cornell University, 
them   selves seeing then for the first time college women.  It is no marvel
   that in every country the barriers of custom and prejudice gave way
   before the immensity of the desire of women born to go to college.
       That the United States is to.-day far in advance of all other
   countries in the number of women obtaining a college education
   is due, it seems to me, to two facts: first, to. our national system
   of coeducational public schools, which had been in operation since
   1845, long before college education was thought of for women, and
   enabled girls to be prepared for college in the same classes with their
   brothers as soon as there were colleges for them to go to; and second,
   to the fact that already in 1870, when colleges opened to women,
   there were more women than men teaching in these same public
