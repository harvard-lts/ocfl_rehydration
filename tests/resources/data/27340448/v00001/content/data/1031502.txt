 4      The Coll&ge Women of the Pre.ent and Fut~&re.

    One by one college women have patiently and successfully
 met and silenced all the a priori objections to college 
education insufficient physical health, inferior scholarly endowment, 
inde comm of conduct in coeducational colleges-and now they are
 again face to face with this new argument of the most insidious
 kind. Even Mr. Howells, in the November Harper's in one of the
 wittiest and wisest of his "Easy Chair" talks, which has to do with
 the impossibility, undesirability and latent cruelty of the 
sugges tion that college women should be educated to be wives and mothers,
 says that "cold statistics represent that only about one out of three,
 or four, or five, educated or coeducated women marry, and of these
 as few again become mothers, or, if they do, survive the cares and
 duties of maternity." But cold statistics, begging Mr. Howells'
 pardon, seem to me to prove just the contrary. In 1885 in the
 United States, and in England in 1890, it was proved from careful
 investigations of the health of 1,271 college women that in marriage,
 child-bearing and child-rearing, they were slightly above, not below,
 the average standard of women. In the June number of the 
maga sine of the American Statistical Association for 1900, there were
 published the results of another investigation, covering 343 
college bred married women and 313 non-collegebred married sisters and
 cousins; and in 1902 there will appear the results of still another
 investigation, covering 3,636 college women, 1,487 non-college
 sisters, and 1,073 college brothers. These four investigations, 
con ducted independently of each other, contain absolutely convincing
 proof of the good results of intellectual work for women. There is
 not a shadow of evidence to prove that a college education works
 anything but physical good to the college woman, or impairs in
 any way her functional life.
    These investigations seem also to prove that only about 50 per
 cent of the classes from which the majority of college women
 come marry, whether they have, or have not, been to college; but
 this is not the fault of college women. College women, like
 other women, are dependent on men for marriage, and the college
 presidents who enjoin upon us to teach women womanly virtues
 and educate them to become wives and mothers should begin by
