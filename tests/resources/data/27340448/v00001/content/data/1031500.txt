ever we may think of the health of women in general, she is at
least the most healthy of all women.  In each successive year girls
are entering college more athletic and in better physical condition;
each year at Bryn Mawr the students eat more pounds of beef and
mutton per head than in the previous year.  This improved physical
condition of women coincides in time with the improvement of
girls' secondary and higher education, and is, I believe, the direct
consequence of it.
   The college woman is also proving herself the most efficient
of all women; she makes so successful a teacher that she is swiftly
driving untrained women teachers out of the private and public
secondary schools and will soon begin to drive them from the 
elementary schools; she is also driving men from the schools.  It is
easy to say that she is employed because her salary is lower, and not
because she is a better teacher; but if this is the explanation, why is
the higher-priced college woman replacing the lower-priced, 
untrained woman in the schools? The same increase in the number of
women teachers as compared with men is found in England and
Scotland and has begun in France and Germany. It is probable that
women are fitted in a peculiar manner to become the teachers of the
 race. The college woman is also slowly entering other professions as
 well as teaching; as librarians college women already outnumber
 men.
    A great deal is said, and a great deal too much is said, of the
 marriage or non-marriage of college women.  Will college life make
 women disinclined to marry?  Do as many college women as other
 women marry?  Do they wish for children?     Will they consent to
 bear them?  Will they be able to bear them?   Will they be able to
 nurse such children as they may bear?    Will not college education
 make them unloving wives and unloving mothers?   No, a thousand
 times, no! The very asking of such questions shows our lack of 
per spective. Who would be foolish enough to suggest that four years of
 normal college life could so profoundly alter the natural instincts
 of a college man as to harden his heart against marriage, deprive
 him of tenderness for children, or of power to beget them, and cause
 him to desert or maltreat wife and family?
