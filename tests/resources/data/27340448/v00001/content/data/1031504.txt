           The College Women of the Pre.ent and Future.            5

educating their own college men to become husbands.        And how
can women be educated in peculiarly womanly virtues unless we
educate them in so-called feminine defects?  Justice, righteousness,
truth, love of knowledge, sympathy,     reasonableness,    are  both
womanly and manly virtues, and happy are our men's or women's
colleges if they teach some tiny fraction of them. How can women
be educated primarily to be wives and mothers?    I do not know.   I
have never met a woman that did know.       I have asked many 
devoted wives and mothers, who have laughed at the preposterous
idea.   What requires the perfection of all our human powers can
scarcely be taught to women in high schools or in colleges by rule
of thumb.
      The college women of the future will be as numerous as, and
probably more numerous than, college men in colleges and 
universities.   Women are now steadily gaining on men; in the college 
departments of some coeducational universities, like Chicago, they are
already in the majority. If we may judge from the continuous
increase of women teachers in the schools for the past thirty years,
the college women of the future will have almost all the elementary
and secondary teaching of the country in their hands and they
will compete with men for professorships in colleges and 
universi ties.  When this is the case, I believe there will be women scholars
 of the highest rank, devoting themselves to research and invention
 and original investigation, as there are now women singers, and
 actresses, and poets, and novelists.  In addition to teaching and
 library work, as at present, the college woman of the future will
 have found certain trades and professions peculiarly suited to her, in
 which she can succeed as well as, if not better than, men. I venture
 to predict that architecture and medicine will be two of these. 
Cer tain divisions of business will tend to fall into her hands, as 
type writing and telegraphy have already become the professions of
 women who have not been to college.
        The college women of the future will not only be self-
support ing, but they will be married to college men as generally as working
 women and women of the wealthy classes are now married to men
 in the same circumstances as themselves.    For the woman who is
