 schools, so that women graduating from college found instant
 employment. It is the good fortune of American women that,
 unlike women in other countries, they did not have to begin their
 college education by creating, slowly and painfully, and without
 state assistance, college preparatory high schools. In consequence
 of these pre-existing conditions, and also of the sympathetic 
atti tude of American men toward women (an attitude which is in
 all probability due also to these same conditions) college women
 in America outnumber by many thousands those of all other 
coun tries taken together. According to the last United States 
educa tional report there were, in the year 1899, studying in the United
 States in the undergraduate departments of 337 coeducational
 colleges, 16,966 women, in 11 independent women's colleges, 3,779
 women, and in affiliated women's colleges, 1,056 women, a total of
 21,801 women then in college, women forming about 28.5 per cent of
 all college students. In the same year there were studying in colleges
 and universities in Great Britain 3,660 women, women forming
 only 12.9 per cent of all college students. About 2,800 women are
 graduated from American colleges every year. The United States
 Commissioner of Education estimates that there were in the United
 States in 1899 three hundred and twenty-three women in college
 out of every million persons.
    Yet, although so few in number, these three hundred and
  twenty-three women in every million are swiftly effecting what
  amounts to a social revolution in thought and opinion; so 
over  whelming is the impression made on us by the college woman that
  we seem to lose all sense of perspective in dogmatising about her.
  Even so acute and friendly an observer as Professor Miinsterberg
  forgets that we have to do with only thirty years of college 
educa  tion affecting only an infinitesimal fraction of all women, when he
  says, in the June number of the InternaUonal Mont/dy, that "neither
  coeducation nor the equality of opportunity has done anything
  to eliminate those characteristics of the female mind which are
  well known the world over." But, whatever may be thought of
  the unreasonableness of women in general, the college woman is at
  least the most reasonable and logical of all women, just as,
