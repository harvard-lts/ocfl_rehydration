 6       The College Women of the Present and Future.

 able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the man she loves in the
 support of the family there will be 100 per cent, and no longer 50
 per cent of marriages. She will indeed be the only woman the
 man of moderate income can afford to marry.
    And the college woman with inherited wealth will be able to
 use her wealth more wisely than now, for in the future all women
 of the leisured classes will go to college, like their brothers, as a
 matter of course; and this tendency is even now clearly marked.
 Two-thirds of the women at present in Bryn Mawr have no 
expec tation of supporting themselves. The college women of the future
 will sit on boards of education and boards of charity in as large
 numbers as men, and they will assume their full share of 
responsi bility in the direction of municipal and national affairs. No one
 who watches the shadows of coming events can doubt this.
    But it is the children of the college women and college men
 of the immediate future that are to build anew the heavens and
 earth of the Twentieth Century. For the last half of the Nine.
 teenth Century the American men of the poorer classes-and they
 alone in the civilised world-have had mothers as well educated
 as their fathers in coeducational primary and secondary schools,
 which do not exist in any other country in the world; and to
 this, more than to any other single cause, are due, it seems to me, the
 phenomenal enterprise and success in commerce of the American
 people. In the Twentieth Century the mothers of our wealthy,
 professional and middle classes will be as well educated as the
 fathers, and we may then expect a like success in spiritual and
 intellectual things.
