This descriptive component was later married to the file mapping portion of the MOA2 file, produced by pasing each pamphlet's page-image files and an associated table in which page enumeration was encoded.Any pamphlet pages, covers, or foldouts that were identified during preparation as having meaningful color were digitally photographed by the HCL Digital Imaging Group and tipped into the page sequence delivered to users through PDS.  Two version of each color image were saved in DRS: A color, 24-bit, uncompressed TIFF file was saved and marked as "master archival"; and a JPEG version, scaled and labeled as the "delivery" version, was created.  Each color image was created in an ISO 3664 compliant environment, and each file was tagged with an ICC display profile.
