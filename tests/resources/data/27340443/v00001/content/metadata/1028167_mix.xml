The descriptive portion of the MOA2 structural metadata was assembled in one of two ways: A) By parsing the MARC record for each title, collecting pagination information that recorded the boundaries between each item's sections (front matter, contents, body text, index, end matter) in a generic, 5-part table, and by transferring pagination encoding from the table provided by the scanning vendor into the page attributes encoded within the item's MoA2 structural metadata; or B) in an effort to offer a richer and more customized set of navigational links for an item, it's structure was recorded using the Digital Imaging Group's Data Collection Tool -- a web-enabled database designed for the collection of descriptive information required for the production of MoA2 structural metadata; this structural metadata was enriched with pagination information, encoded by the scanning vendor in tables, and then transferred to the page attribute elements within the item's MoA2 structural metadata files.
Any of item's pages, covers, or foldouts that were identified during preparation as having meaningful color were digitally photographed by the HCL Digital Imaging Group, tipped into the page sequence, and delivered to users through PDS.  Two version of each color image were saved in DRS: A color, 24-bit, uncompressed TIFF file was saved and marked as "master archival"; and a JPEG version, scaled and labeled as the "delivery" version.  Each color image was created in an ISO 3664 compliant environment, and each file was tagged with an ICC display profile.
