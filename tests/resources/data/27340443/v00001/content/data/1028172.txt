    The Honorable Herbert B. Shonk, Republican Assemblyman, also
of Westchester County~ introduced the same bill in the Assembly.
The bill thus became known as the Mastick-Shonk 48-hour week bill.
This bill, in accordance with the Republican pledge, provided for a
48-hour working week for women in factories and mercantile 
establishments, with an eight-week seasonal exemption for seasonal 
employment.
    Senator Nathan Strauss, Jr., and Assemblyman Samuel L 
Rosenman (Democrats), both of New York City, introduced a 48-
hourweek bill without seasonal exemption in accordance with the 
Democratic platform pledge.  Both the Senate and the Assembly had a
Republican majority, however, and the Mastick-Shonk bill seemed
certain to be enacted. The Strauss-Rosenman bill died in 
committee. On February 19th Assemblyman Joiner (Republican) 
introduced a bill in the Assembly which he claimed to be a 48-hour week
bilL

Joiner   This measure provided, as the present law does, a nine-hour
54-How day and 54-hour week, but it would empower the Industrial
Bill     Board "to investigate conditions in occupations or processes
         in which women are employed in factories or mercantile
establishments to determine whether or not the number of hours
worked are detrimental to the health of the women.. ." with power
to reduce hours to not less than 48 a week.
    On February 26th the organizations in favor of the 
MastickShonk 48-hour-week bill, led by the Joint Legislative Conference,
attended a hearing at Albany before the Labor and Industries 
Committees, urging the passage of the Mastick-Shonk bill in accordance
with party pledges, and opposing all the other so-called 48-hour bills
introduced by Republicans, including the Joiner bill.
    Shortly after this the Republican Assemblymen held a conference,
at which was discussed the question of whether the majority would
support the Shonk bill or the Joiner bill. They decided in favor of
the Joiner bill, although it did not provide for a 48-hour week with
provision for seasonal exemptions in accordance with the party pledge.
    On March 16th the Joiner bill passed the Assembly; 78 
Republicans voted for it and 16 Republicans and all the Democrats voted
against it.
    Came the last day of the legislative session, March 27th. The
Mastick-Shonk bill had failed to be reported by either the Senate or
Assembly Committees on Labor and Industries. A final appeal was
made to the Assembly Rules Committee, which had a Republican 
majority membership. The Committee did not report the bill, although
the Speaker was Chairman and the majority leader was a member.
    Senator Mastick moved for the discharge of the Senate Committee
ontheMastick48-hourweekbill. Thiswascarriedbyonevote, all
the twenty-two Democrats and four Republicans supporting the
motion.  Senator Mastick then moved for the final reading and
passage of his bill, and the Mastick bill was passed by a vote of 39 to
12; the twelve adverse votes were cast by Republicans. Immediately
after the passage of the Mastick bill, the Joiner bill was called up and
