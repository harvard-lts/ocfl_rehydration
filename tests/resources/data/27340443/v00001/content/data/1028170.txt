Drifting  The question of enacting 48-hour legislation was before
          the 1925 session of the New York State Legislature, as it
has been before previous sessions for twelve years.
   No measure of equal importance has ever drifted for so many
years without the slightest effort on the part of the legislative 
majority to take some decisive action.  Year after year the legislative
majority has evaded a decision. Theirs has been a strictly negative
position in the face of thousands of letters, telegrams, and personal
appeals on behalf of the 3OO,OOO~ New York State working women
immediately concerned.
   Why?     Chiefly because the Legislature has been more influenced
by the Associated Industries (the Manufacturers' Association) than
by the women workers and their supporters.  It has seemed not a
question of justice but a question of overcoming the opposition of the
Associated Industries to a proposal which many of the biggest
employers believe to be in the best interests of both employers and
employees. The establishment of a 48-hour working week for women
will do more than any other factor to stabilize employment and
production, increase the quality of workmanship and, most important
of all, will contribute hugely to the strength and well-being of future
generations, as testified to by authorities on this subject.

Why a         Specialized operations in a machine age compelled
48-How        attention to hours worked by women, for deep concern
Week Law?     about the health of women workers was inevitable as
              working conditions taxed the strength of the workers
more and more.
   Enlightened opinion has realized, too, the right of women 
workers to a fuller life outside their work places, the right to leisure for
education, recreation, participation in civic matters, or any other field
which attracts them.
The 48-How    It is important that workers shall not suffer a loss in
Week and the wages when hours are reduced, and so whether or not
Pay Envelope a reduction in the number of working hours per week
              means a reduction in earnings is of concern. Figures
available from the New York State Department of Labor show that
the 48-hour week does not reduce earnings.  In a study of Hours
and Earnings of Women in Five Industries it was found that a higher
rate of pay n'as gh~en for full time Por& in establishments rvith scheduled hours
of 48 or less, than for full time r,or4: in establishments twith longer hours.
