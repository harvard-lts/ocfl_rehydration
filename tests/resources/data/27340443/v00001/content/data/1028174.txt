passed by a majority of one vote, all the Democrats and three 
Republicans voting against it. Thus, the Joiner bill passed both Houses.
     Governor Smith sent a special message to the Assembly in a
futile effort to persuade the Republicans to pass the Mastick-Shonk
bill.  In his statement he said in part: "The Senate bill (Mastick), as
I have already indicated, carried out the party pledges and promises
made last Fall.  The Assembly has adopted a so-called 48-hour bill
known as the Joiner bill, which is not a 48-hour bill at all, but a fraud
upon the people of the State.
     Under the guise of getting them a 48-hour week bill this measure
in fact permanently establishes the present 54-hour week, but provides
that under certain complicated and unworkable conditions the 
Industrial Board may reduce the hours. ... This is an entirely 
unworkable proposition and one which will simply cause confusion and delay
and accomplish nothing."
     Assemblyman Shonk moved that the Mastick bill, which by its
passage in the Senate, had been referred to the Assembly for action.
be taken from the Rules Committee and put on order of final passage.
The motion was lost, but sixteen Republican Assemblymen stood
with the Democrats for the measure, thus supporting their party
platform.

Joiner   Governor Smith held a public hearing on the Joiner bill on
Bill     April 16th and announced at that time that he would veto
Vetoed   the bill. The Women's Trade Union League was one of
         twenty organizations representing Labor and women's
organizations which requested the Governor to veto the Joiner bill,
believing it to be unworkable and absolutely without merit.

Demand Good      This is the truthful story of a broken party pledge.
Faith of Your    A pledge the meaning of which is understood in
Representatives  the English language to mean a guarantee for the
                 per! ormance of an act. The Republicans were bound
to the voters of this State by a promise which should have been
sacred. Their candidates were elected on the principles contained in
the Party Platform.

We             To the end that those men who forgot their principles,
Ask Your       rode roughshod over their pledges, ignored their
Cooperation    guarantee for the performance of an act shall understand
               that a basic principle of our Democracy is that of good
faith between the people's representatives and the people whom they
represent.
