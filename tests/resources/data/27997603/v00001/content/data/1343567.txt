Woman's Place in a Scheme of Agricultural

                           Education



(Abstract of remarks by Dean Bailey before Girls' Club of the College of
                   Agriculture, November 11, 1910.)

    You may ask me why I need to raise the question of woman's place in
any scheme of education.  The reason is purely historical  Woman has
not had her recognized place in schemes of education.
    We know that education has come up out of class and of privilege.
Not all men, let alone women, have had equal opportunities in the plans
of education. In the evolution of educational institutions, all persons are
now finding their places and are contributing their several parts to the
various schemes.
    The ultimate object of education by means of agriculture is to redirect
country life. The redirection of country life rests on two corner,
which are, improved farming and improved home. If it is essential
that the man be trained in better farming methods, it is equally essential
that the woman be trained in better householding methods.
    The farm and the home are the two underlying factors in the country
life development. As the strength of a 'chain is determined by its weakest
link, so will the development of rural civilization be determined by the
weakness of the farm as an economic unit, or by the weakness of the
home as a social unit. It follows, therefore, that the woman has equal
and co-ordinate part with the man in the redirection of rural society. She
will be able not only to create a sentiment for better farming itself, but
it is to be expected that her best contribution will be to create a quickened
sentiment in respect to the home and householding end of country
life. I do not mean to restrict woman's activities, but we must recognize
the law of nature that certain activities are primary and that others are
secondary..
                  THE FARM WOMAN'S OUTLOOK.

    The farmer has lived on his farm; he is now acquiring a world out-
look.
    The woman has lived in her house; she also is acquiring a world
outlook.
    As the house has been smaller and more confining than the farm, it
has followed that woman's outlook has been smaller than man's.
    As the effectiveness of the farmer's outlook is conditioned on his
ability as a farmer, so is the effectiveness of a woman's outlook condi-
tioned on her ability as a home. This is why this College of Agri-
culture aims first to make a man a good farmer; it is equally the reason
why it aims first to make a woman a good housekeeper. To put the iaat-
ter in another phrase, as it is the first necessity that the countryman be
a good business man, so is it of the first importance that the country
woman should be domestic.   I should not restrict this remark to country
men or country women.   It is equally applicable to all other men an 1
women.
