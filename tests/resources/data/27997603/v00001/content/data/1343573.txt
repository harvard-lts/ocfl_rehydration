    4.  Do not accept too much help just because you are women.        In
your regular college work you are not engaged in social affairs; you are
working on a different plane.
    5.  You should never force yourself into activities just because you
are women; that is, you are not to take advantage of your sex.    This is
more important in its effects on the men perhaps, than on yourselves, for
as you begin to demand your rights" in student affairs you are likely to
dull the chivalry of the men students.
    6.  Go freely into all student activities whenever you feel that you
can contribute something. Stay away when there is nothing that you can
contribute to the welfare or efficiency of the association or the enterprise.
This will not limit your activities, but rather increase them. You will be
surprised to find how many ways there are in which you can contribute
something very much worth while, and also how much your presence will
be desired.
    7. Report all incivilities and all arbitrary handicaps at once to the
Director's office. I do not assume that there have been any incivilities;
nor do I know that there are any handicaps in this institution more than
there are for men.  In the interest of equal opportunity and of progress,
however, the Director's office should know whenever such may occur, in
order that they may be corrected, not only in justice to the student who
feels them, but also that the work as a whole may be properly coordinated.

                    THE OFFICIAL OBLIGATION.

    An obligation rests on the administration of the College to see that all
opportunities are completely equalized.  I am perfectly clear as to the
policy that the Director's office should take in administering affairs of
the women students.   It must be the policy that no door shall be closed
to any person because such person is a woman or is a man; what door
you, as a student, shall enter must be determined by you yourself and it
must be your own responsibility.
