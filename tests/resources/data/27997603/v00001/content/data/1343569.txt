     Whatever a woman may gain, she must never lose her domesticity.
 Her effectiveness as a social agent depends directly on her retaining the
 natural womanly qualities.
     Things and affairs that formerly have been in the foreground may
 now need to be relegated to the background. We are placing new values
 on all activities. I will mention a few of these in order that you may
 know exactly what I mean. I am saying them not because they may be
 peculiar to women but because I am speaking to women.
     1. Women must escape the customary small range of conversation.
 The smaller the range of conversation, the more narrow is the horizon of
 life. Very small conversation is gossip. The gossiper is always a self-
 centered person. The measure of ones contact with life is necessarily re-
 flected in the subjects of conference and conversation. You have only to
 take note of the conversation of groups of men and women anywhere to
 satisfy yourselves of this fact. We ordinarily condemn gossiping as wrong
 from the moral point of view; I prefer at present to say that it indicates a
 small range of interests and does not develop such contact with life as is
                                                      .
 worth while.
     2.  It is bound to be necessary, if woman is to take her larger part in
 the world's activities, that she develop a different attitude toward per-
 sonal apparel I do not have it in mind to criticise any garment that
 a woman wears. I do not know of any garment that is more inartistic
 and more ludicrous than a man's dress coat; but the point is not here:
 men's clothing is standardized. Women's clothing is to a large extent not
 standardized. Men's styles change from year to year, but the range is
 very narrow. The result of it is that a man expends much less energy in
 providing apparel than a woman does.   I presume that we should never
 standardize women's clothing as narrowly as men's clothing is standard-
 ized, but there is certainly need of much effort in that direction. I think
 it is the place of college women to spread the idea that first artists
 in clothing should be employed in women's work and to overcome the
 notion that radical styles may be set arbitrarily. Very much human
 energy is wasted in trying merely to readapt oneself to changing fashions,
 which are largely set by commercial firms that they may secure financial
 advantage therefrom.   This handicap is well recognized by educated
 women. The difficulty is that the trades in women's apparel have not yet
 caught up with our best judgment, and the women of the present day are
 living, therefore, in a trying position.
     3. I think that educated women who are to carry much responsi-
 bility of the world's work must overcome some of the common notion
 that they are of right to be "entertained." A person who is resourceful
 entertains himself or herself. Of course I do not mean by this that one
 is to withdraw from associations with ones fellows, or in any way to
 isolate oneself; It is possible to be resourceful without being separate.
     4. The means whereby woman is to broaden her influence is first to
 broaden her own and undisputed sphere and not merely to adopt man's
 sphere. In the nature of things, there is division of labor between men
 and women. If there are certain duties that inhere in man's estate, there
are certain other duties that inhere in woman's estate. I have no desire
to say what a woman's work shall be; but it is very apparent that she
must be master of her own problem before she can solve anbther's
problem.
             THE DEPARTMENT OF HOME ECONOMICS.

    If the customary subjects in the College of Agriculture are organized
and designed to train a man for efficiency in country life and to develop
his outlook, so also is the Department of Home Economics In this College
to train a woman for efficiency and to develop her outlook to life. A de-
partment of home economics, therefore, is not a concession to public
