opinion, or even alone to the special needs of woman's education. It is a
necessity as a means of developing society.
    Home economics is not one department" in the sense in which
dairying or entomology or soils is a department.    It is not a single
specialty. It stands for the whole development of woman's work and
place.  Many technical or educational departments will grow out of it as
time goes on.
    Of course, I would not limit the entrance of women into any courses
in the College of Agriculture; on the contrary, I want all courses open to
them freely and on equal terms with men: but the subjects that are ar-
ranged under the general head of home economics are their special field
and sphere. On the other hand, I do not want to limit the attendance of
men in courses of home economics; in fact, I think it will be found that
an increasing number of men desire to take these subjects as the work
develops, and this will be best for society in general
    Furthermore, I do not conceive it to be essential that all the teachers
in Home Economic subjects shall be women; nor, on the other hand, do
I think it is essential that all teachers in the other series of departments
shall be men.   The person who is best qualified to teach the subject
should be the one who teaches it.
    My attitude, therefore, is that home subjects are just as essen-
tial a part of a college of agriculture as any other subject whatever, and
that we cannot expect to make much progress in the redirecting of country
life until these subjects are as well developed as the technical agricultural
subjects. There is no longer any necessity of explaining why home-
making subjects are necessary in this institution. The number of young
women are increasing.   The work is recognized as of equal value and
standing with other work. It will grow and will take care of itself. I hope
for the time when there will be just as many women in the College of
Agriculture as there are men.

    THE PLACE OF THE WOMEN STUDENTS IN THE COLLEGE.

    There is much discussion as to just how far the women students in
the College of Agriculture should go in partaking in student activities.
and what their relation shall be to the general social development of the
institution. I do not wish in any way to dictate. I shall not lay down any
rules. I think that I have never given a positive personal order to any
student or any member of the staff since I have been Director of the
College. I prefer only to make suggestions and to let them work out as
they may.   If these suggestions appeal to the good sense of those to
whom they are made, they will work themselves out.   If they do not ap-
peal to the good sense they will be of no effect, and I shall have made
merely one more er or.   In this way the good will be saved and the ill
will be winnowed out.
    I have a few suggestions, somewhat in the nature of principles or
lines of action, to make to you. I do not wish to apply these principles,
but I give them to you baldly and let you apply them as you may.
    1. Here you are to live out your own lives to the fullest. They are
women's lives.
    2. You are to contribute your part to the college welfare. It is to be
a woman's part.
    3. You are to recognize the fact that in the nature of things there
is division of labor as between men and women. Your work will be useful.
speaking in broad terms, in proportion as it is unlike man's work and as
it complements man's work. This does not mean that all women are to
engage only in what has heretofore been considered to be woman's work
or that they are not to enlarge their sphere; but I think that you will
catch the drift of any statement.
